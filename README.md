This is my final project in the Global AI Introduction to Machine Learning Program.

**Project Summary:**
Using the Kaggle dataset "Mushroom Classification," this project aims to determine the edibility of mushrooms based on their descriptions. The dataset covers 23 species, each labeled as edible or poisonous. Employing logistic regression, ridge classifier, decision tree, Naive Bayes, and neural networks, the project evaluates and compares the performance of each model to identify the most effective classification method.
